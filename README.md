# team-profile-generator

## Description
The objective of this project was to create a program that can generate a team of employees based upon the user's input. The program is ran through the command line in the terminal and begins once the user enters "node app.js". They are then prompted with questions and the html document is appended to include the answers the user gave. The CSS framework, Bootstrap, was used to style the output into individual cards for each generated employee.
